This repository contains the code for a Magento 2 Catalog Configuration assignment project that was completed for Scandiweb company.

The goal of the project was to implement a custom catalog configuration that allows store administrators to specify different catalog settings per store view.
This includes the ability to enable or disable certain product attributes, change the sort order of attributes, and set custom labels for attributes.
A custom theme was added based on the Magento Luma theme and includes custom styles, templates, and layout updates to create a unique look and feel for the store.
